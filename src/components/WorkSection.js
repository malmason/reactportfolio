        </p>
        <p>Hi! Welcome to my shop! :) My name is Natasha and I'm from sunny San Diego. I started candle 
          making as a hobby and to make some great gifts. But it became so much more, very quickly!
        </p>
        <p>I realized candle making is a lot like cooking. I loved the freedom of creating something that 
          can be enjoyed by all.
